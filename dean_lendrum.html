      <p><strong>Anthony Bettini – CEO, Vulncheck:</strong><br />
      "Dean was asked to work on a new DAST feature at Tenable, from scratch. The feature itself was basically a product. Dean completely over-delivered, and if his work had been done by a team of 5 people, it would still have been impressive. But it was just Dean—quite an accomplishment."
